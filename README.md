I analyzed a toxicity report that involved comments on wikipedia which examined comments and highlighted a toxicity report on them. My hypothesis was that if I changed comments such as “I love you” to “I hate you”, the toxicity in the report would increase. I went through the data, replaced comments and analyzed the toxicity in order to observe the changes. After changing the positive words to negative ones, I learned that my hypothesis was incorrect. The toxicity report remained consistent and unchanging. I think biases could be involved here because people tend to lean their anger and “toxicity” based on online messages and comments on things such as wikipedia. The behavior of people tend to change fairly quickly as well. Because of this, it makes me wonder if sites such as wikipedia can be trusted due to the changes in the way people tend to feel when writing comments. Even with more negative words, the toxicity did not change which can lead to question the credibility of this source.
